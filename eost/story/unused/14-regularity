The unneccessary axiom (not essential? skippable...)

* The axiom of regularity
* formal definition
* correspondence to non-existence of a chain of sets decreasing by "being element"
* connection to ordinals
* the well-founded core
  * every ordinal is built at its level
  * regularity guarantees that every set is there, proof skipped
* forbidding axiom, not providing
* nice for inner peace but not really important
