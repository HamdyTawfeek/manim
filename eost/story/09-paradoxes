A world full of paradoxes
=========================

* ordinal of all ordinals
* powerset of the set of all sets
* run diagonal argument -> Russel's paradox
* the problem: a kind of circular definition
* We cannot solve it by giving a list of what is forbidden, we need stable rules of what is allowed
  * but we want everything seen in previous chapters to work
* idea of the system:
  * everything is a set
  * we can imagine sets as a graph, axiom will give rules to the graph
  * set vs. class, classes are outside the imaginary world, sets are safe, classes not so much
