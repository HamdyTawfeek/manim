Formal numbers
==============

* first idea of naturals: $0 = \{\}, 1 = \{\{\}\}, 2 = \{\{\{\}\}\}$
* problems:
  * they are one-element sets, it is difficult to count with it
  * we cannot generalize it to ordinals, what $\omega$ or $\omega+1$ should be?
* standard construction
  * "Argh! I cannot imagine it!"
  * "You don't have to do it in this way"
  * $5 = \{0,1,2,3,4\}$ is sufficient expansion, programming
  * 5 as a graph
  * extra feature: it is implementing the natural correspondence
    between ordinals as types of well ordered sets and ordinals as indices to them
    explained in chapter~\ref{ordinals}
  * supremum is real union
* existence of omega1
* what about cardinals? wait for chapter~\ref{cardinals}
