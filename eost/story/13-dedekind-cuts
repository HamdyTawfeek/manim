Uncountable chain in $\P(\omega)$ and real numbers (not essential? skippable...)
==================================================

Mirek: It may not be essential but it has very well connected terminology with ordinal supremum and Zorn's lemma (chains)

* The problem of uncountable chain in $\P(\omega)$
* construction of real numbers by Dedeking cuts.
* beware circular definition
* supremum in real numbers is actually the same as in ordinals
