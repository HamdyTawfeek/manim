Formal recursion
================

* this will be pretty technical but
  * it is good to see how the theory of infinity and the foundation of mathematics are connected
  * it can help to avoid a feeling that the next chapter is just a hand-waving
* example: a set is not well ordered, why does it contain an infinite decreasing sequence?
* recall the intuitive proof
* but: "You cannot use infinitely many steps in a proof."
  * "What? I am doing it all the time."
  * "It can be avoided by a clever one-at-a-time operations"
  * example with the Cantor's theorem
* recursion as an induction
  * why did it help?
  * induction as a proof by contradiction
* one more problem: limit step require determinacy
  * how to use the axiom of choice here
* recapitulation:
  * recursion is a kind of induction but we need determinacy for limit steps
  * we can assure the determinacy by running the axiom of choice before launching the recursion
  * induction is a proof by contradiction, that is why we formally need well-order
* exercise: every infinite set is at least countable


This chapter will be pretty technical. 
And it not necessary to know the details
