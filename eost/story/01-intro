The infinite world
==================

Quote: No one shall expel us from the Paradise that Cantor has created. (David Hilbert)

Outline
=======

* Who is it good for?
  * People who would like to have a better understanding of popular paradoxical examples with infinity, or to see the solution of the Russel's paradox
  * Mathematicians who are using set theoretical tools such as cardinalities / Zorn's lemma and would like to understand it.
  * Students of a set-theoretical course drowning in formalisms.
* Scheme
  * A visual, intuitive approach, originally motivated by a construction of as large set as possible, chapters~\ref{set-size-comparison}--\ref{omega1}
  * Link to appropriate amount of formalism and motivation behind it, chapters~\ref{paradoxes}--\ref{formal-recursion}
  * Standard but non-trivial tools of set theory, chapters~\ref{zorn-lemma}--\ref{cardinals}
* distant from applied math
* creating a new world for mathematicians
* fun fact: Czech slang abbreviation of set theory is ``darkness''
* so why to study it?
  * it is wonderful, people like the idea of an ideal infinite world
  * it is solid, it gives you boundaries what can be proven and what cannot
* corresponding two roles of set theory
  * the theory of infinity
  * foundation of mathematics
* basic principles
  * infinity is actual
  * infinity is not just a large number
* example: infinite grid can be colored blue-yellow in such a way that
  * every row contains just finite number of blue cells
  * every column contains just finite number of yellow cells
  * that would not be possible if infinity were just a large finite number

. Hello, welcome to the essence of set theory. Since the video can be
. watched by a diverse population, let's clarify at first what is all
. this going to be about.
.
. Set theory is a mathematical discipline founded by Georg Cantor in the
. nineteenth century.
. The theory studies the infinity. Or rather infinite sets to be
. precise.
:------------------------HotelScene-----------------------------
. If you've heard about some cool stuff with infinity like an
. infinite number of buses of infinite amount of people fitting into a
. single hotel having just infinite number of rooms...
:-----------------------PrisonersScene-----------------------------
. Or an infinite number of prisoners such that almost
. all of them guess their hat correctly, it is likely to be strongly
. connected to this discipline.
.
. To be honest, it is actually our main reason why we study
. it. Because it is beautiful.
:----------------------TwoSetTheoryRoles---------------------------
. It provides to a mathematician a whole
. amazing world just for their ideas. Sorry, nothing for practically
. oriented people who want to see direct applications in real world. You
. don't meet the infinity on a street.
.
. But then there is also another reason why the theory is important, it
. is solid.
. It turned out that intuitive thinking about infinity can easily lead
. to direct contradictions like that a set is an element of itself if
. and only if it isn't. So mathematicians developed a formal axiomatic
. framework to deal with that. And it turned out that their solution is
. so universal that it covers virtually any mathematical field.
.
. Therefore, set theory actually plays two roles in mathematics, the
. theory of infinity and the foundations of mathematics.
.

:---------------------------ChapterList------------------------------
. We start with
. the intuitive theory of infinity in several chapters, then we describe
. the problems and their solution by providing an axiomatic
. framework. The series will be finished with some non-trivial tools of
. set theory like the principle of maximality.

:--------------------------InfinityBasics-----------------------------
. To begin with the theory of infinity, we have to clarify what infinity
. means to us.
. What is it besides just the symbol of rotated number
. eight? Actually, we are not going to answer this question, we will not
. use even the symbol of infinity in the series anyway. We will
. investigate a bit different problem, what is infinite? Of course,
. infinite is what is not finite. That answer was cheap. But finiteness
. can be defined quite simply, finite set is such a set that the
. number of its elements can be expressed by a natural number.
. A set of five elements is finite.
. A set of one hundrets elements is finite. But
. the set of all natural numbers is too big to be measured by a natural
. number, so it is infinite.
.
. Even an empty set is a finite set, that is why we consider zero as a
. natural number, which may be unusual in other fields but it is very
. natural in set theory.
. 
. According to this definition, the answer to our original question is
. definitelly not just a large natural number. The point is that
. infinite sets behave in unexpected ways and that is the area of the
. study. Consider the following problem.

:---------------------------GridColoring-------------------------------
. We have a grid five by five and we are coloring it by
. two colors, yellow and blue. If we color it in such a way that all
. the rows are predominantly blue, it may happen that some columns are
. predominantly yellow. But not all of them.
. If we fix the remaining columns that they are predominantly yellow, we
. break some of the rows.
.
. It is impossible to get all the rows mostly blue and all the columns
. mostly yellow. We cannot fill the table in such a way that
. there is more blue in it, and more yellow in it at the same time.
.
. But what if we pick an infinite
. grid? There is a colorization of the grid such that every row contains
. just finite number of yellow squares and every column contain just a
. finite number of blue squares. We recommend you to pause the video and
. think about it for a while. You can take your paper and pencil for help.
. ...
. [wait for 10 seconds]
. ...
. There comes the solution. Do you see? Every row is blue up to a
finite number of squares and every column is yellow up to a finite
number of blue squares. The impossible task in the finite world became
possible for infinite grid. And that is just the beginning.

In the next chapter we will learn how to compare sizes of infinite
sets. See you then.
