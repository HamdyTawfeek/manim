The infinite world
==================

Quote: No one shall expel us from the Paradise that Cantor has created. (David Hilbert)

Outline
=======

* Who is it good for?
  * People who would like to have a better understanding of popular paradoxical examples with infinity, or to see the solution of the Russel's paradox
  * Mathematicians who are using set theoretical tools such as cardinalities / Zorn's lemma and would like to understand it.
  * Students of a set-theoretical course drowning in formalisms.
* Scheme
  * A visual, intuitive approach, originally motivated by a construction of as large set as possible, chapters~\ref{set-size-comparison}--\ref{omega1}
  * Link to appropriate amount of formalism and motivation behind it, chapters~\ref{paradoxes}--\ref{formal-recursion}
  * Standard but non-trivial tools of set theory, chapters~\ref{zorn-lemma}--\ref{cardinals}
* distant from applied math
* creating a new world for mathematicians
* fun fact: Czech slang abbreviation of set theory is ``darkness''
* so why to study it?
  * it is wonderful, people like the idea of an ideal infinite world
  * it is solid, it gives you boundaries what can be proven and what cannot
* corresponding two roles of set theory
  * the theory of infinity
  * foundation of mathematics
* basic principles
  * infinity is actual
  * infinity is not just a large number
* example: infinite grid can be colored blue-yellow in such a way that
  * every row contains just finite number of blue cells
  * every column contains just finite number of yellow cells
  * that would not be possible if infinity were just a large finite number
