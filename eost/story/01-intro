The infinite world

=======

* Who is it good for?
  * People who would like to have a better understanding of popular paradoxical examples with infinity, or to see the solution of the Russel's paradox
  * Mathematicians who are using set theoretical tools such as cardinalities / Zorn's lemma and would like to understand it.
  * Students of a set-theoretical course drowning in formalisms.
* Scheme
  * A visual, intuitive approach, originally motivated by a construction of as large set as possible, chapters~\ref{set-size-comparison}--\ref{omega1}
  * Link to appropriate amount of formalism and motivation behind it, chapters~\ref{paradoxes}--\ref{formal-recursion}
  * Standard but non-trivial tools of set theory, chapters~\ref{zorn-lemma}--\ref{cardinals}
* distant from applied math
* creating a new world for mathematicians
* fun fact: Czech slang abbreviation of set theory is ``darkness''
* so why to study it?
  * it is wonderful, people like the idea of an ideal infinite world
  * it is solid, it gives you boundaries what can be proven and what cannot
* corresponding two roles of set theory
  * the theory of infinity
  * foundation of mathematics
* basic principles
  * infinity is actual
  * infinity is not just a large number
* example: infinite grid can be colored blue-yellow in such a way that
  * every row contains just finite number of blue cells
  * every column contains just finite number of yellow cells
  * that would not be possible if infinity were just a large finite number

Hello, welcome to the essence of set theory. Since the video can watch
a diverse population, let's clarify at first what is all this going to
be about.

Set theory is a mathematical discipline studying the infinity, in
particular infinite sets. If you've heard about some cool stuff with
infinity, like you can "There is the same amount of rational numbers as
of the natural numbers." or "You can divide a ball into ten parts and
then compose two separate balls of the same size from the parts.", or
"Almost all of the infinite amount of prisoners can guess the color of
their hat.", it is strongly connected to this discipline.

On the other hand, students studying set theory may be struggling with
the topic. Drowning in weird symbols and definitions, they would often
say that it is not a coincidence that the Czech shortcut for Set
Theory is Darkness. Sometimes it seems as two isolated world. The cool
infinite stuff, which we call the Theory of infinity, and the playing
with axioms and formal definitions which we call The foundation of
mathematics.

But there are two reasons why these two roles come under one
theory. When you are thinking about the intuitive theory of infinity, you meet
some contradictory behaviour which looks like the whole math is
broken. This is the reason why any deeper disquisition of set theory
needs a formal framework. And the second reason is that it turned out
that the formal framework of the theory of infinity is so powerful
that it can span virtually any mathematic field. And the adventage is
that this mathematic field can immediatelly apply the results of set
theory such as the Zorn's lemma. So if you ask a mathematician what
are the most bottom foundations of his theory, you will get likely a
respond the Set theory, of course.

We are trying to build a bridge between these two approaches. The
series is going to be image-driven, but giving a self-contained
picture of set theory. We begin with the theory of infinity, that are
cardinal and ordinal numbers, Then we will continue with the problems
of the intuitive approach and the solution of them. And the series
will be finished with basic, but by no means trivial tools of set
theory.
