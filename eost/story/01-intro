The infinite world
==================

Quote: Set theory has a dual role in mathematics. In pure mathematics, it is the place where questions about infinity are studied. Although this is a fascinating study of permanent interest, it does not account for the importance of set theory in applied areas. There the importance stems from the fact that set theory provides an incredibly versatile toolbox for building mathematical models of various phenomena. (Jon Barwise, Lawrence Moss)

Outline
=======

* Who is it good for?
  * People who would like to have a better understanding of popular paradoxical examples with infinity, or to see the solution of the Russel's paradox
  * Mathematicians who are using set theoretical tools such as cardinalities / Zorn's lemma and would like to understand it.
  * Students of a set-theoretical course drowning in formalisms.
* Scheme
  * A visual, intuitive approach, originally motivated by a construction of as large set as possible, chapters~\ref{set-size-comparison}--\ref{omega1}
  * Link to appropriate amount of formalism and motivation behind it, chapters~\ref{paradoxes}--\ref{formal-recursion}
  * Standard but non-trivial tools of set theory, chapters~\ref{zorn-lemma}--\ref{cardinals}
* distant from applied math
* creating a new world for mathematicians
* fun fact: Czech slang abbreviation of set theory is ``darkness''
* so why to study it?
  * it is wonderful, people like the idea of an ideal infinite world
  * it is solid, it gives you boundaries what can be proven and what cannot
* corresponding two roles of set theory
  * the theory of infinity
  * foundation of mathematics
* basic principles
  * infinity is actual
  * infinity is not just a large number
* example: infinite grid can be colored blue-yellow in such a way that
  * every row contains just finite number of blue cells
  * every column contains just finite number of yellow cells
  * that would not be possible if infinity were just a large finite number

. Hello, and welcome to essence of set theory.
:------------------------HotelScene-----------------------------
. If you've heard about some cool stuff with infinity, like how an
. infinite number of buses with an infinite amount of people can fit into
. a single hotel with an infinite number of rooms...
:-----------------------PrisonersScene-----------------------------
. Or how an infinite number of prisoners wearing colored hats can coordinate
. so that almost all of them can guess their own hat color correctly,
. it is likely to be strongly connected to set theory.
:------------------------CantorScene-----------------------------------
. Set theory is a mathematical discipline founded by Georg Cantor in the
. nineteenth century. At its core, set theory is the study of infinity: or
. rather, infinite sets, to be precise.
.
. To be honest, understanding infinity is actually the main reason why we study
. set theory. To a mathematician, infinity is beautiful.
:----------------------TwoSetTheoryRoles---------------------------
. It provides to a mathematician a whole amazing world just for their ideas.
. Of course, that means if you're a practically
. oriented person who wants to see direct applications in the real world, sorry. You
. don't meet infinity walking down the street.
.
. But there is also another reason why set theory is important: it gives a solid
. framework for mathematics in general. Following your intuition about infinity
. can easily lead to paradoxes, so mathematicians developed a formal axiomatic
. framework to deal with that. And it turned out that their solution is
. so universal that it covers virtually any mathematical field.
.
. Therefore, set theory actually plays two roles in mathematics, not only is it the
. theory of infinity, but it's also the very foundations of mathematics.
.

:---------------------------ChapterList------------------------------
. In the first few videos, we'll start with some intuition for infinity.
. Then we'll explain the problems with that intuition and solve it by
. introducing a framework in terms of a few axioms. Then we'll finish with
. some more advanced tools of set theory like the principle of maximality.

:--------------------------InfinityBasics-----------------------------
. To begin thinking about infinity, we have to define it. What do
. we mean by a rotated number eight? Actually, that question is too vague
. for us to answer. We won't even use the infinity symbol in this series.
. Instead, we'll try to define "infinite size". So what's something infinitely big?
. Of course, there's a cheap answer: something infinitely big is something not
. finitely big. But "finitely big" is easy to define: a finitely big set is just
. a set where the number of elements in that set can be expressed as a natural number.
. A set of five elements is finite. A set of one million elements is finite too. But
. the set of all natural numbers is too big to be measured by a finite natural number.
. So the set of all natural numbers is infinitely big.
.
. Even an empty set is a finite set: it has zero elements. That's why we
. consider zero as a natural number, which may be unusual in other fields
. but it is very natural in set theory.
.
. According to this definition, the answer to our original question is
. definitelly not just a large natural number. The point is that
. infinite sets behave in unexpected ways and that is the area of the
. study. Consider the following problem.

:---------------------------GridColoring-------------------------------
. We have a grid five by five and we are coloring it by
. two colors, yellow and blue. If we color it in such a way that all
. the rows are predominantly blue, it may happen that some columns are
. predominantly yellow. But not all of them.
. If we fix the remaining columns that they are predominantly yellow, we
. break some of the rows.
.
. It is impossible to get all the rows mostly blue and all the columns
. mostly yellow. We cannot fill the table in such a way that
. there is more blue in it, and more yellow in it at the same time.
.
. But what if we pick an infinite
. grid? There is a colorization of the grid such that every row contains
. just finite number of yellow squares and every column contain just a
. finite number of blue squares. We recommend you to pause the video and
. think about it for a while. You can take your paper and pencil for help.
. ...
. [wait for 10 seconds]
. ...
. There comes the solution. Do you see? Every row is blue up to a
finite number of squares and every column is yellow up to a finite
number of blue squares. The impossible task in the finite world became
possible for infinite grid. And that is just the beginning.

In the next chapter we will learn how to compare sizes of infinite
sets. See you then.
