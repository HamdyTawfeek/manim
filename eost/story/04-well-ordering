In previous chapters we have seen that when we take the set of all
subsets of natural numbers, we get a bigger set. The set of all
natural numbers is usually denoted by a greek letter omega and
includes the number zero which is rather technical detail for
now. Taking the set of all possible subsets is denoted by the
calligraphic letter P meaning "power set". So P of omega is bigger than
omega. And we have also shown that the power set is a universal tool
for making sets bigger. So P of P of omega is even bigger than P of
omega, and P of P of P of omega is even bigger. Let's try to construct
as large a set as possible. We continue by taking a further power
set. And again, and again. For any natural number $n$, we can
construct a set created by $n$ gradual applications of P.

"So let's find a big integer"
Does it mean that for finding a large infinite number, we need to find
a large finite number? No, because we live in the infinite world. We
are not limited by natural numbers. We can just take all of them at
once and merge all of the appropriate sets. This merging is called the
union and using that we get a set which is even bigger than all the
preceding. But we are not finished yet. We can again take the power
set, and again, and again, and so on, and then the union.

The process happening here is called transfinite recursion. An
ordinary recursion is just something living on natural numbers. We
define the thing we start with, in our case omega, and the recursive
step, in our case taking the power set of the previous set.
But transfinite recursion can do one more, it can combine the data
collected in previous steps even if there is no immediately preceding
one. This kind of a recursive step is called a limit step while the
usual recursive step, allowed to rely on the immediately preceding
value, is called the successor step.
So in our case, the zero step of the transfinite recursion is omega,
the successor step is taking the power set, and the limit step is
union. But the key question here is: What is the thing the transfinite
recursion live on? The usual recursion is easy, it lives on natural
numbers, but what about the transfinite one? In fact this question is
quite tricky. On one hand, whenever we begin to see a pattern in the
transfinite resursion, we can take the limit step and overcome it. On
the other hand, transfinite recursion does not work on everything, it
fails, for example on positive real numbers.

So in this chapter and several following ones we will talk about the
mysterious world of transfinite recursion. A better understaning of
what can we afford here will help us to produce the super large-sets
which we wanted at the beginning.

Let's see why we cannot proceed by transfinite recursion on positive
reals. At first, we need to start with the zero step somewhere. That
is, we need the set have to a minimal element. But positive reals does
not have it, for any positive real number, there is another positive
real which is smaller. This can still be fixed, let's add zero and
take positive reals with zero.

Now we assign omega to the point zero on the real axis. But... what next?
If we take any other real number, we inevitably skip an infinite
amount of real numbers between zero and our chosen number. That is a
problem, not just that the set itself has to contain a minimal element
but even every element have to have a successor in it.

This assures us that we can run the successor step every time. But
what about the limit step? Take the following example: one infinite
increasing sequence and a two-sided infinite sequence behind it. The
set itself has a first element, so we can assign zero. Every element
here has a successor, so we can run successor steps and get P
omega, P P omega and so on... But what next? Now we should run the
limit step, but there is no next bar which can be assigned to
it. Again, whenever we assign the union to a bar here, we skip
infinitely many previous elements.

# moconnor: I think the use of the words "beginning" and "ending" here
# is not standard, it took me a minute to figure out what it meant.
# 
# I think the standard term for "beginning" (at least in set theory)
# is "initial segment".  I don't think there's a corresponding standard
# term for ending.  However, Wikipedia lists some choices, although
# not in the context set theory: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_set
#
# I would favor either calling "beginning"s initial segments and not
# referring to endings (instead just saying that every non-empty subset
# has a lower bound from the outset) or calling them "downward closed"
# and "upward closed" sets

# Mirek: I agree that it is not standard, if there is a more
#   standard notation, it would be nice. "Initial segment" sounds
#   really good, so the problem is how to call the opposite in a natural
#   way. I hope that the visualization, two complementary terms and
#   examples will help the listeners to understand it.
#
#   How would an ordinary person call the opposite of "initial segment"?
#   What about "terminal segment"?
#
#   It is not necessary to have entirely standard terminology,
#   we need a terminology that will be understood.
#
#   "Downward closed" and "upward closed" are acceptable but I
#   prefered not so technical terms.
#
#   Arbitrary non-empty subsets are in my opinion less imaginable,
#   less motivated and not so necessary. I prefer my
#   definitions throughout the text (first elements of "endings"
#   and no infinite decreasing sequence). But you can try to
#   write it in the more standard way.
#
#   I don't know how to make arbitrary subsets natural
#   here. Motivations that came to my mind are:
#
#   * To make the induction as convenient as possible. But I would
#     like to postpone such technical details.
#   * To make the definition as simple as possible in the elementary
#     language of set theory.

# moconnor: Also what does the phrase "filled elements" mean in the paragraph
# below?

# Mirek: I mean filled by the recursion, or used, simply the elements
#   which have an assigned value

So it does not suffice that every element has a successor. We need
to have a successor of any beginning. Whenever we take a set of filled
elements from the beginning, there have to be the next element.

But saying it in this way, we are not able to construct anything
because the set itself can be considered as its beginning. So let's
simplify it and accept such sets that transfinite recursion can
run through all of its elements even though the set does not cover the
complete world of the transfinite recursion. In this simplification,
the last element, if there is one, does not have to have a successor
anymore.

So, we are interested in such sets that every beginning which does not
cover everything have the successor. It is actually the same as saying
that every non-empty ending have the first element, endings are just
complements to beginnings.

A very special case of such beginning can be an empty beginning. When
no element is filled yet, the corresponding ending is the whole set
itself, so the necessity of having the entirely first element is
covered by the condition too.

So this condition, "every non-empty ending has a first element", is
sufficient for the transfinite recursion. Any set satisfying this is
called a well-ordered set, and the ordering itself is called
well-ordering. When we want to construct a large set by the
transfinite recursion, we need to find a well-ordered set long enough.

We finish this chapter with an alternative view of what well ordered
sets mean. In fact, the only obstacle is an infinite decreasing
sequence. Really, whenever there is an infinite decreasing sequence,
it divides the set into a beginning and a non-empty ending without a
first element. There cannot be the first element because the sequence
goes backward and backward. And conversely, any non-empty ending
without the first element contains enough space for an infinite
decreasing sequence. The absence of a first element assures that
sequence cannot get stuck.

So we have two ways how to determine whether a set is well ordered
set, that means we can run the transfinite recursion on it. One way is
to investigate all the non-empty endings and check whether all of them
have their first elements. And the second way is to ensure that there
is no infinite decreasing sequence in it.

But if you will search for the definition of well ordering by your
own, you will probably meet the following one: Not just every ending
but every possible non-empty subset has its first element. So, you can
try to think over why the meaning is still the same.

Next time, we will meet ordinal numbers and we will learn the indexing
meaning of well ordered sets. See you then.
