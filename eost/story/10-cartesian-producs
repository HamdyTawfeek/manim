Quote: Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things. (Henri Poincare)

* motivation, definition
* examples: $\omega^2, \R^2, \R^3$, graph theory
* What is formally an ordered pair?
  * not everything is working, $\{\{a\}, b\}$: $b$ of form $\{x\}$
  * usual definition $\{\{a\}, \{a,b\}\}$ (Kuratowski)
  * what hapens when $a=b$
* obtaining the cartesian product by axioms
  * by double application of replacement and union
  * by two powersets and selection
* formal view of a function
  * function graph
  * graph-theoretical graph
  * function vs. class function
