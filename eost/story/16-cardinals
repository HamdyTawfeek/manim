What are cardinal numbers good for
==================================

* how to formally measure the cardinality?
* use specific ordinals -- weird but working
* ``cardinal numbers are more than just an amount''
* recursion on a cardinal
  * simple example: alternative solution to the grid coloring from chapter~\ref{intro}
  * example: there is a set of points in the plane having 3-element intersection with every circle
  * why ordinary recursion on ordinals fails?
