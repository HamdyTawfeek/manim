:------------- 02.NotationSceneForChapter7 -----------------
For this chapter, you will need to understand the notion of
countability and uncountability and

basic properties of ordinal
numbers and operations with them discussed in previous
chapters. Namely, you need to know that a countable set remains
countable when you add just a countable many elements to it or if you
take an union of countable many countable sets, understand the
transition between ordinals as order types of well-ordered sets and
ordinals as indeces into well ordered sets, and comprehend the
supremum of an arbitrary set of ordinals.

So if you don't feel well in any of these topics, we recomend you to
return to the appropriate chapters. This chapter is going to be a bit
tough but really cool. We are going to construct and investigate an
uncountable ordinal.

:-------------------- Supremum -------------------------

Here we go.

Let's take the set of all possible countable ordinals. That are omega,
omega plus five, omega times three, omega to the power of three and
much more. Then we take the supremum, that is another ordinal called
omega one.

: "Hey, in the previous chapter you said that taking all ordinals is forbidden."

In chapter 5, we have mentioned that we are not allowed to
take the set of all ordinals, so why is it possible to take the set of
all countable ordinals? We will discuss the reason in more detail
later in the series after we will have established axioms and other
formal stuff. In the meantime let's explain an intuitive reason. We
can take all natural numbers, that is omega. And since omega is just a
set, there is in a sense just a limited number of possibilities how to
reorder it. By taking all of these possibilities, we actually get all
the countable ordinals except the finite ones.

: -------------------- Omega1Visualization ---------------------------

All right, what are properties of omega one, that is the supremum? It
is certainly bigger, in the ordinal sense, than any of the countable
ordinals. So omega1 is an ordinal but is it not a countable
ordinal. Therefore it must be uncountable. It is the least uncountable
ordinal number.

Does it sound weird? 

: -------------------- AnalogyOmega -------------------------------

Let's make an analogy with a more familiar
example, the finite ordinals. If we take all the finite ordinal
numbers and make their supremum, we get the least infinite ordinal
number, the omega, so it had to be a supremum of infinite amount of
ordinal numbers. Similarly, if we take the supremum of all countable
ordinals, we get the first uncountable ordinals so we had to merge an
uncountable amount of ordinals, otherwise the result were
countable. This analogy can be extended a bit.

Notice what are the indices of omega, that are natural numbers, the
finite ordinal numbers. Similarly, the indices of omega one are exactly
the countable ordinals. So omega one itself is, in a sense, the set of
all countable ordinals. The indexing meaning of an ordinal computes
the number of preceding elements, so every element of omega one
splits the set into a countable number of previous elements and an
uncountable number of following elements. It is analogous to the
fact that every natural number splits omega to a finite number of
previous elements and an infinite number of succeeding elements.

: ------------------- LeastInfinite ---------------------------

In chapter 2, we showed that omega is the least infinite set. We can
reformulate the argument into the language of ordinal numbers in the
following way. Whenever we take a subset of omega and align it to an
initial segment of omega, just two possibilities can happen. Either the
subset forms a less ordinal, it is finite then, or it fills the whole
omega again. The idea of alligning to an initial segment is a general
concept of ordinals which we have shown in chapter five, it is
the comparison of ordinal length. Any subset of a well-ordered set
have to be well-ordered as well, there cannot appear a decreasing
sequence by discarding some elements. So we can apply this idea to
omega one too.

: ------------------- LeastUncountable ---------------------------

Take a subset of omega one and align it to an initial segment of
it. There are two possibilities. The order type of the subset is
either less than omega one, that means that it is a countable ordinal,
or it get aligned to the whole omega 1, so its size is the same of
omega 1. Because any subset of omega one is either countable, or of
the same size, the size of omega one have to be the least uncountable,
it is called aleph 1.

: ------------------- ContinuumHypothesis -------------------------

That casts a new light to the continuum hypothesis mentioned in
chapter 3. Continuum hypothesis is a question whether the continuum,
that is the size of real line, is the least uncountable cardinal
number. Until we knew omega one, the natural answer is "Why not?" "Why
should be here a weird set somewhere between reals and omega which
cannot be proven to exist anyway." But now, we have the set. The set
of the least uncountable cardinality is in front of us, it is omega
one. So the continuum hypothesis transformed into a question whether
there the sizes of omega one and real line is the same. And the
natural answer is now "Why?" "Why should be there a weird matching
between omega one and reals which cannot be proven to exist anyway."
But as we have said, the question is proven to be unaswered forever,
so let's go on.

: ------------------ CountableSupremum --------------------

Another analogy between omega and omega1 may the following
one. Whenever we take a finite number of finite ordinals, their
supremum is finite too, in fact it is the largest one. Since
countable ordinals are indexing omega it can be
reformulated in the sense that any finite subset of omega have its
supremum in omega too.

From chapter 2 we know that an union of countable number of countable
sets is still countable. So the supremum of countable number of
countable ordinals is still countable. But all countable ordinals are
the indices of omega1, so, the supremum of any infinite increasing
sequence in omega1 is still in omega1. Despite the similarity with
omega, this behavior is the source of the most counterintuitive
properties of omega1.

: ------------------ RealEmbedding -----------------------

For example, real numbers does not have this property. There is a
an increasing sequence of real numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on which
cannot be bounded from top by a real number. So we are kind of
cheating when we are vizualizing omega1 as bars on line. It may seem
that it is possible to choose an infinite sequence of elements of
omega1 approaching its end. But it is not true. There is still an
uncountable number of elements between the end of the sequence and the
end of omega1.

: -------------------- LongLine -------------------------

At the and, let's show another interesting mathematical object called
the long line. Let's start with the simple omega and replace each bar
by a left-closed right-open interval. So the result looks again as a
left-closed, right-open interval.

The choice of including left point and excluding right point was
important. We need exactly one endpoint excluded so the intervals fit
together. And if we used left-open, right-closed interval we would end
with an open interval since omega has no last element. But when we
used left-closed, right-open interval, we got exactly the same result.

Using the notion of ordinal arithmetics we could say that left-closed,
right-open interval times omega is still left-closed, right-open
interval. Well, the interval is not a well-ordered sequence, so it is
not exactly ordinal arithmetics but it works the same.

And this fact holds for any nonzero countable ordinal. We can composed
the interval omega times two times. Or omega times omega times. The
result is the left-closed, right open interval.

But things become different composing it omega1-times. The initial
segment is still the same. In fact any proper initial segment
corresponds to an interval because any proper initial segment of
omega1 corresponds to a countable ordinal. But the whole thing called
long line is somehow longer. Every infinite increasing sequence in the
long line has its supremum in the long line.

By this example we have closed the part of our series concercing the
naive theory of infinity. Next time we will investigate some
paradoxes which has to be handled and introduce the formal world. See
you then.
