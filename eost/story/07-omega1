:--------------- CardinalsOrdinalsRecap -----------------
. For this chapter, you will need to understand the notion of
. countability and uncountability and
. basic properties of ordinal
. numbers and operations with them discussed in previous
. chapters.
. Namely, you need to know that a countable set remains
. countable when you add just a countable many elements to it or if you
. take an union of countable many countable sets, understand the
. transition between ordinals as order types of well-ordered sets and
. ordinals as indeces into well ordered sets and
:------------------- SupremumRecap ----------------------
. comprehend the supremum of an arbitrary set of ordinals.
. 
. So if you don't feel well in any of these topics, we recomend you to
. return to the appropriate chapters. This chapter is going to be a bit
. tough but really cool. We are going to construct and investigate an
. uncountable ordinal.

:-------------------- Supremum -------------------------
.
. Here we go.
. 
. Let's take the set of all possible countable ordinals. That are omega,
. omega plus five, omega times three, omega to the power of three and
. much more. Now we take the supremum. We align all of them to the
. left and merge them. The result is another ordinal number called
. omega one.
. 
. : "You've said in chapter 5 that taking all ordinals is forbidden."
. : "We are using just the countable ones."
.
. In chapter 5, we have mentioned that we are not allowed to
. take the set of all ordinals, so why is it possible to take the set of
. all countable ordinals? We will discuss the reason in more detail
. later in the series after we will have established axioms and other
. formal stuff. In the meantime let's explain an intuitive reason. We
. can take all natural numbers, that is omega. Since omega is just a set, 

:------------------- Reorderings ------------------------------------
.
. there is in a sense just a limited number of possibilities how to
. reorder it. By taking all of these possibilities, we actually get all
. the countable ordinals except the finite ones.
.
: -------------------- Omega1Intro ---------------------------
.
. All right, what are properties of omega one, that is the supremum? It
. is certainly bigger, in the ordinal sense, than any of the countable
. ordinals which. We can see a countable ordinal as an index of omega1
. or as its proper initial segment.
.
. So omega1 is an ordinal but it is not a countable
. ordinal. Therefore it must be uncountable. It is actually the least
. uncountable ordinal number. So even the appropriate terminal segment
. have to be uncountable.
. 
. Does it sound weird? 
. Let's make an analogy with a more familiar
. example, the finite ordinals.

: -------------------- AnalogyOmega -------------------------------
.
. If we take all the finite ordinal
. numbers and make their supremum, we get an ordinal which is longer
. than any finite ordinal. Any element of omega, that is a finite
. ordinal, divides omega into a finite initial segment and an infinite
. terminal segment. This analogy can be extended a bit.
. In chapter 2, we showed that omega is the least infinite set. We can
. reformulate the reasoning into the language of ordinal numbers in the
. following way.

: ------------------- LeastInfinite ---------------------------
.
. Whenever we take a subset of omega and align it to an
. initial segment of omega, just two possibilities can happen. Either the
. subset forms a strictly less ordinal, it is finite then, or it fills
. the whole omega again. The idea of alligning to an initial segment is
. a general concept of ordinals which we have shown in chapter five, it
. is the comparison of ordinal length. Any subset of a well-ordered set
. have to be well-ordered as well, there cannot appear a decreasing
. sequence by discarding some elements. So we can apply this idea to
. omega one too.

: ------------------- LeastUncountable ---------------------------
.
. Take a subset of omega one and align it to an initial segment of
. it. There are two possibilities. The order type of the subset is
. either less than omega one, that means that it is a countable ordinal,
. or it get aligned to the whole omega 1, so its size is the same of
. omega 1. Because any subset of omega one is either countable, or of
. the same size, the size of omega one have to be the least uncountable,
. it is called aleph 1.
.
. That casts a new light to the continuum hypothesis mentioned in
. chapter 3.
.
: ------------------- ContinuumHypothesis -------------------------
.
. Continuum hypothesis is the question whether the continuum,
. that is the size of real line, is the least uncountable cardinal
. number. It is a question which is proven to be unanswerable.
. 
. Until we knew omega one, the natural answer is "Why not?" "Why
. should be here a weird set somewhere between reals and omega which
. cannot be proven to exist anyway." But now, we have the
. cardinality. The set of the least uncountable cardinality is in front
. of us, it is omega one. So the continuum hypothesis transformed into a
. question whether there the sizes of omega one and real line is the
. same. And the natural answer is now "Why?" "Why should be there a
. weird matching between omega one and reals which cannot be proven to
. exist anyway." But as we have said, the question is proven to be
. unaswered forever, so let's go on.

:------------------ UnboundedOmega --------------------
.
. We return to the finite and infinite subsets of omega. We can tell
. when a subset gets aligned to the whole omega. It is in that cases
. when the subset does not stop before the end of omega, no matter how
. sparse such set can be. More formally, it is aligned to omega if it
. has some elements in every nonempty terminal segment of omega. Such
. sets are called unbounded.
. 
. ...
. 
. Indeed, if the subset is aligned just to a propper beginning of omega,
. there are just a finite number of points in it, so there is the last
. one. And behind that point remains the vast majority of omega.
. The case of omega1 is similar.

:------------------- UnboundedOmega1 --------------------
.
. If a subset got aligned to just a proper initial segment of omega1, it
. was just a countable subset. Well, not every countable subset has a
. maximum but every set of ordinals have its supremum. And since the
. union of countably many countable sets is still a countable set, the
. supremum of countable many countable ordinals is a countable
. ordinal. So it points inside omega1. Behind that point there is
. the vast majority of omega1 which remained untouched by the subset.
. 
. Despite the similarity with omega, this behavior omega1 is the source
. of its most counterintuitive properties. It says that every
. infinite increasing sequence in omega1 is bounded because its supremum
. still lies in omega1. We are actually cheating when we are
. vizualizing
. omega1 like a points in real line. It is easy to construct an
. increasing sequence in an interval which is approaching the endpoind
. of the interval. But omega1 still has allways an uncountable part behind.
.
. At the end of the chapter, we will see another interesting mathematical
. object based on this property, the long line.
.
: -------------------- IntervalMul -------------------------
.
. Let's start with two
. intervals closed on one end and open on the other. If we join them, we
. get again an interval of the same type.
.
. It does not depend yet whether we started with left-closed right-open
. interval, or with the other one. But a difference appears when we join
. them omega times. Since omega does not have the last element, the
. merged intervals does not contain the right endpoint either. So if we
. still want the interval of the same type, we have to start with the
. left-closed right open interval.
.
. And we can continue. Add another such interval, and next,
and so on. In fact, the left-closed, right-open interval times any
countable ordinal results in a left-closed right-open interval.

"Shouldn't the result be longer than the first factor?"
If you remember previous chapter, we mentioned that the product of two
ordinal numbers is greater than the first one.
"Interval is not well-ordered."
But the multiplication here is not exactly ordinal arithmetics. It is
based on the same definition but it can have even weirder
properties. Namely if the interval does not get changed if we multiply
it by any countable ordinal number.

:---------------------- LongLine --------------------------------
.
. But it become different when composed omega1-times. Such a thing --
. interval copied omega1-times is called the long line.
. Initial segments are still the same. Any proper initial segment of the
. product looks like an ordinary interval in real numbers because any
. proper initial segment of omega1 is a countable ordinal. But the whole
. thing is somehow longer. Unlike real numbers, every
. infinite increasing sequence in the long line has its supremum in the
. long line. So even though it resembles the real line pretty much, the
. long line somehow managed to be even longer.
. 
. By this example we have closed the part of our series concercing the
. naive theory of infinity.

:-------------------- NextChapter -----------------------------

Next time we will investigate some
paradoxes which has to be handled and introduce the formal world. See
you then.

: "Is there a set of all sets?"
: "Sure, why shouldn't be?"
: "What about the set of all sets not containing themselves?"
: "Just discard some elements of the previous one?"
: "Does such a set contain itself?"
: "Oops..."
