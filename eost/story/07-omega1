For this chapter, you will need to understand the notion of
countability and uncountability and basic properties of ordinal
numbers and operations with them discussed in previous
chapters. Namely, you need to know that a countable set remains
countable when you add just a countable many elements to it or if you
take an union of countable many countable sets, understand the
transition between ordinals as order types of well-ordered sets and
ordinals as indeces into well ordered sets, and comprehend the
supremum of an arbitrary set of ordinals.

So if you don't feel well in any of these topics, we recomend you to
return to the appropriate chapters. This chapter is going to be a bit
tough but really cool. We are going to construct and investigate an
uncountable ordinal.

Here we go.

Let's take the set of all possible countable ordinals. That are omega,
omega plus five, omega times three, omega to the power of three and
much more. Then we take the supremum, that is another ordinal called
omega one.

In chapter 5, we have mentioned that we are not allowed to
take the set of all ordinals, so why is it possible to take the set of
all countable ordinals? We will discuss the reason in more detail
later in the series after we will have established axioms and other
formal stuff. In the meantime let's explain an intuitive reason. We
can take all natural numbers, that is omega. And since omega is just a
set, there is in a sense just a limited number of possibilities how to
reorder it. By taking all of these possibilities, we actually get all
the countable ordinals except the finite ones.

All right, what are properties of omega one, that is the supremum? It
is certainly bigger, in the ordinal sense than any of the countable
ordinals. So the supremum itself is uncountable, it is the least
uncountable ordinal number.

Does it sound weird? Let's make an analogy with a more familiar
example, the finite ordinals. If we take all the finite ordinal
numbers and make their supremum, we get the least infinite ordinal
number, the omega, so it had to be a supremum of infinite amount of
ordinal numbers. Similarly, if we take the supremum of all countable
ordinals, we get the first uncountable ordinals so we had to merge an
uncountable amount of ordinals, otherwise the result were
countable. This analogy can be extended a bit.

Notice what are the indices of omega, that are natural numbers, the
finite ordinal numbers. Similarly, the indices of omega one exactly
the countable ordinals. So omega one itself is, in a sense, the set of
all countable ordinals. The indexing meaning of an ordinal computes
the number of preceding elements, so every element of omega one
splits the set to a countable number of previous elements and an
uncountable number of following elements. It is analogous to the
fact that every natural number splits omega to a finite number of
previous elements and an infinite number of succeeding elements.

In chapter 2, we showed that omega is the least infinite set. We can
reformulate the argument into the language of ordinal numbers in the
following way. Whenever we take a subset of omega and align it to an
initial segment of omega, just two possibilities can happen. Either the
subset forms a less ordinal, it is finite then, or it fills the whole
omega again. The idea of alligning to an initial segment is a general
concept of ordinals which we have shown in chapter five, it is
the comparison of ordinal length. Any subset of a well-ordered set
have to be well-ordered as well, there cannot appear a decreasing
sequence by discarding some elements. So we can apply this idea to
omega one too.

Take a subset of omega one and align it to an initial segment of
it. There are two possibilities. The order type of the subset is
either less than omega one, that means that it is a countable ordinal,
or it get aligned to the whole omega 1, so its size is the same of
omega 1. Because any subset of omega one is either countable, or of
the same size, the size of omega one have to be the least uncountable,
it is called aleph 1.

That casts a new light to the continuum hypothesis mentioned in
chapter 3. Continuum hypothesis is a question whether the continuum,
that is the size of real line, is the least uncountable cardinal
number. Until we knew omega one, the natural answer is "Why not?" "Why
should be here a weird set somewhere between reals and omega which
cannot be proven to exist anyway." But now, we have the set. The set
of the least uncountable cardinality is in front of us, it is omega
one. So the continuum hypothesis transformed into a question whether
there the sizes of omega one and real line is the same. And the
natural answer is now "Why?" "Why should be there a weird matching
between omega one and reals which cannot be proven to exist anyway."
But as we have said, the question is proven to be unaswered forever,
so let's go on.
