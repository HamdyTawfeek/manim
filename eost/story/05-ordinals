There is just one true well-ordering
====================================

Outline
=======

* ordinals as abstraction of well-ordered sets, analogy to numbers as abstractions of counted sets
* ordinals cannot fork
* supremum
* ordinals as indices of elements of a larger ordinal, Warning: 0 = first element
* interpretation of supremum in the view of indices
* Is there an ordinal containing all ordinals? Rather no, wait for chapter~\ref{paradoxes}
