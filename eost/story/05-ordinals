There is just one true well-ordering
====================================

Outline
=======

Mirek:
I am not completely sure what exactly and in what order it should be
so that it sound motivated the best.
The main message I want to convey in this chapter is:
 "Ordinals have two roles:
   (1) Types of well ordered sets,
   (2) indeces of an universal well ordering.
I also want to explain supremum here, so that it can be
used in further chapters about ordinal arithmetics and omega1.


Some random ideas what can be shown (in some order, other things can be skipped):

* Any two well ordered sets can be aligned in a unique way so that one
  matches with an initial segment of the other.
  * This is in the contrast with the fact that omega and reversed
    omega cannot be matched at all and there are multiple ways how to
    match Z with itself.
  * From the "transfinite recursion" point of view, this is not
    very surprising.
  * Emphasise the difference between 
* Ordinals are abstractions of well ordered sets as well as
  natural numbers are abstraction of numbers of things.
* System in terminology
  (1) "transfinite recursion"
  (2) "well ordered set"
  (3) "well ordering"
  (4) "ordinal (number)"
  * The most important are (1) and (4)
* Supremum of ordinals
  * We can align infinite number of ordinals and get an even bigger
    one by that.
  * meaning in the index point of view
* set-index correspondence
  * What happens when we run transfinite recursion with supremum
    as a limit step and '+1' as a successor step?
    * Mirek: I like the idea, it serves as an example of transfinite recursion as
      well as of use of the supremum
  * By the definition of well ordering, there is a correspondence
    between non-terminal segments and indices. It can be further
    translated into the standard correspondence.
  * Warning: Index correspond to the sccessor, not the last element.
    * There is a reason for that, some ordinals (the limit ones) does
      not have the last element.
  * The 'universal ordering', ordinals indeing ot
    * Is there an ordinal containing all ordinals? Rather no, wait for chapter~\ref{paradoxes}
