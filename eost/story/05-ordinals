There is just one true well-ordering
====================================

Outline
=======

Mirek:
I am not completely sure what exactly and in what order it should be
so that it sound motivated the best.
The main message I want to convey in this chapter is:
 "Ordinals have two roles:
   (1) Types of well ordered sets,
   (2) indeces of an universal well ordering.
I also want to explain supremum here, so that it can be
used in further chapters about ordinal arithmetics and omega1.


Some random ideas what can be shown (in some order, other things can be skipped):

* Any two well ordered sets can be aligned in a unique way so that one
  matches with an initial segment of the other.
  * This is in the contrast with the fact that omega and reversed
    omega cannot be matched at all and there are multiple ways how to
    match Z with itself.
  * From the "transfinite recursion" point of view, this is not
    very surprising.
  * Emphasise the difference between 
* Ordinals are abstractions of well ordered sets as well as
  natural numbers are abstraction of numbers of things.
* System in terminology
  (1) "transfinite recursion"
  (2) "well ordered set"
  (3) "well ordering"
  (4) "ordinal (number)"
  * The most important are (1) and (4)
* Supremum of ordinals
  * We can align infinite number of ordinals and get an even bigger
    one by that.
  * meaning in the index point of view
* set-index correspondence
  * What happens when we run transfinite recursion with supremum
    as a limit step and '+1' as a successor step?
    * Mirek: I like the idea, it serves as an example of transfinite recursion as
      well as of use of the supremum
  * By the definition of well ordering, there is a correspondence
    between proper initial segments and indices. It can be further
    translated into the standard correspondence.
  * Warning: Index correspond to the successor, not the last element.
    * There is a reason for that, some ordinals (the limit ones) does
      not have the last element.
  * The 'universal ordering', ordinals indexing it
    * Is there an ordinal containing all ordinals? Rather no, wait for chapter~\ref{paradoxes}

Script proposal from moconnor:

Recall from the second and third chapters, we talked about sizes: finite
sizes, countably infinite sizes (aleph 0) and some uncountable sizes as well
(beth 1 = |R| = |P(N)|).  Our strategy was that we first showed how to tell if two
sets had the /same/ size [replay matching animations], and then had these numbers
represent all sets of a given size.

Determining the sizes of sets is a very important concept in set theory.
However, there's another way that sets can be used in set theory (and
mathematics) that we discussed in the last chapter: sets that come with a
well-ordering can be used as the basis for a recursive construction.

# Mirek: The idea of analogy with cardinals can be a nice
#   start. However I have some comments
# * I think that we can mention the name 'cardinal number' in
#   chapters 2,3 so there it would be rather a recap. Otherwise
#   it would be a weird place to introduce them here since we are
#   not going to talk about them for a while.
# * I want to convey essential background ideas, similarly as in the
#   last chapter where I emphasised that well-ordered sets are those on
#   which transfinite recursion works. There is what I have in mind for
#   cardinals and ordinals:
#   * Cardinal number describes what the set looks like if we ignore
#     meaning of its elements
#   * Ordinal number is the same but we care about the ordering
#     now.
#   * Bigger ordinal means that the transfinite recursion will run
#     in some sense longer (connection to the previous chapter!)
#   * Visual difference:
#     * For cardinality, we are allowed to reorder elements
#     * For ordinality, we are allowed just to align them
#       * By the way, this 'alignment' point of view is useful for supremum
#     * An example with two well ordered sets of the same cardinality
#     	but different ordinality. 
#
# * Mention that we actually did not really care about the elements in the last
#   chapter either. But technically, n and 1-2^n are different
#   sequences -- that is why ordinals are introduced.
# * Math issue: either A < B or A = B or A > B (not <=), and for having the
#   unique matching, we have to require matching with an initial
#   segment, not just arbitrary subset (it makes really sense from the
#   transfinite recursion point of view).


Just like our first conception of "number" classified sets by possible matchings
to other sets, our second conception of "number" will classify /well-ordered/
sets by the recursive constructions they allow. To distinguish the two, the
first type of number, which we've already discussed, is called a /cardinal/
number (or /cardinality), while the second is called an /ordinal/ number (or
just an /ordinal/). You may not have heard of this distinction before, because
as it turns out, these two conceptions are exactly the same for finite numbers,
and only really differ when we get to the infinite case.

So, how does this work? Well, recall that in the first construction, we said
that sets had the same size (or now, /cardinality/) if there was any matching at
all between their elements. Furthermore, we said that a set A had a lower size
than a set B if there was a matching from A to some subset of B, and /no/
matching from A to all of B.

So, for our second construction, we'll say that /well-ordered/ sets represent
the same /ordinal/ (or: have the same /order-type/) if there's an
/order-preserving/ matching between the two. Similarly, we'll say that A
represents a lower ordinal than B does, if there is an /order-preserving/
matching from A to a subset of B. In fact, it turns out that if there's an
order-preserving matching from A to a subset of B, there's in fact a (unique)
order-preserving matching from A to an /initial segment/ of B.

Just like the cardinality case, this satisfies what's called /trichotomy/:
For any two well-ordered sets A and B, either A <= B, A = B, or A >= B
(we can use the squiggly versions of these relations).
