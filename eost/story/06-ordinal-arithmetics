Ordinal arithmetics
===================

Outline
=======
* addition
* plus is not commutative, $x + \hbox{anything} > x$
* $1+\omega=\omega$ as a race, two turtles, one with a head start
* $\omega + x = x$?
* $x = omega \cdot omega$
* multiplication
* times is not commutative in the same direction as plus, again $x \cdot \hbox{anything} > x$ (if $\hbox{anything} > 1$)
* $2\cdot omega=omega$ as a race between turtle and a hare
* how the turtle catches the Achiles at $\omega^\omega$, still countable

This chapter may not be so essential, ordinal addition and
multiplication are definitelly less usual operations with ordinal
numbers than the supremum and adding one which we have seen in the
last chapter. But we regard it important to get in touch with ordinals
a bit before we meet the ordinal Omega 1 which is far more important
but also far less imaginable.
