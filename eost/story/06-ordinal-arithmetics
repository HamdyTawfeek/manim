Ordinal arithmetics
===================

Outline
=======
* addition
* plus is not commutative, $x + \hbox{anything} > x$
* $1+\omega=\omega$ as a race, two turtles, one with a head start
* $\omega + x = x$?
* $x = omega \cdot omega$
* multiplication
* times is not commutative in the same direction as plus, again $x \cdot \hbox{anything} > x$ (if $\hbox{anything} > 1$)
* $2\cdot omega=omega$ as a race between turtle and a hare
* how the turtle catches the Achiles at $\omega^\omega$, still countable
