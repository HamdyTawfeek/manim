Ordinal arithmetics
===================

Outline
=======
* addition
* plus is not commutative, $x + \hbox{anything} > x$
* $1+\omega=\omega$ as a race, two turtles, one with a head start
* $\omega + x = x$?
* $x = omega \cdot omega$
* multiplication
* times is not commutative in the same direction as plus, again $x \cdot \hbox{anything} > x$ (if $\hbox{anything} > 1$)
* $2\cdot omega=omega$ as a race between turtle and a hare
* how the turtle catches the Achiles at $\omega^\omega$, still countable

. In the last chapter we have introduced ordinal numbers as order types
. of well ordered sets and their indexing role. This chapter about
. ordinal arithmetics may not be so essential, ordinal addition and
. multiplication are definitelly less usual operations with ordinal
. numbers than the supremum and adding one which we have seen in the
. last chapter. But we regard it useful to get in touch with
. ordinals and their indexing meaning a bit more before we meet the
. ordinal Omega 1 in the next chapter, which is far more important but
. also far less imaginable.


We have mentioned ordinal addition in the last chapter when we labeled
some infinite ordinals as omega plus one, omega plus two, and so
on. If we want to sum two ordinals, say omega and three, we just
place one after the another. Quite natural, isn't it? But the fact
that ordinals actually determine ordering causes some behaviour that
is not so natural. Namely, order matters. The ordinal omega plus
three is really three steps longer than omega. But in the other
direction, three plus omega is just omega. The three elements lose in
the infinite omega.

We can vizualize it in the index meaning of ordinals. Consider two
turtles Gordon and Steve racing on ordinals. Gordon starts at the
point zero and but Steve is starting ahead by three steps. Now, they
begin to run. After one step, Gordon is at the position one while
Steve is at the position three plus one, that is four. It is similar
for the second step, third step, and so on.

But than comes the limit step. Although Gordon was three steps behind
Steve all the time, both of them just managed to run through the
omega. So at the limit step, both turtles jump to the point omega. In
Steve's case we can interpret is as three plus omega because he
started with a head start but the point is the same. From now one,
our turtles run one next to the other. So three plus any infinite
ordinal equals the infinite ordinal.

This is in the contrast with the case omega plus three which can be
seen as follows. Both turtles run next to each other for omega steps
and then Steve makes three more steps. No matter, how much they
traveled at the beginning, Steve will be ahead. So three plus alpha
where alpha stands for any infinite ordinal equals alpha, while alpha
plus three is bigger than alpha.

What if the head start of Steve were larger? You can imagine that a
head start of ten steps does make much difference but what if it
starts omega steps ahead? When Gordon gets to omega, Steve is already
gone at the point omega plus omega, omega times two for short.
When Gordon gets to the point omega times two, Steve is at omega times
three.
TODO: let the spectator guess the solution
But in the end, there is the supremum of all natural multiplies
of omega. And both turtles get to that point at the same time. The
supremum is called, reasonably enough, omega times omega.

That brings us to the next topic in this chapter, the ordinal
multiplication. Take two ordinals, say omega and two. If we want to
compute their product, we take the first one as a base and copy it so
many times as suggests the second ordinal. That is, every point of the
second ordinal is replaced by a copy of the first one.

And again, order matters, it was important to write the product in the
order omega times two. Let's see what happens if we multiply it in the
opposite way two times omega. So we replace every point of omega by
two. The result is just omega.

We can again interpret it as a race. Let the turtle compete with a
rabbit. Rabbit is faster than a turtle, when a turtle moves by one,
the rabbit jumps two steps forward. They both start at the point
zero. After one step, turtle is at the point one, rabbit at the point
two times one. After three steps, turtle is at the point three, rabbit
is at the point two times three, that is six. And at the limit step,
the turtle catches the rabbit. So two times omega equals omega. At the
next successor step, the rabbit escapes again, and at the next limit
step, the turtle catches it again. So two times alpha equals alpha for
any limit ordinal alpha.

It is similar to the addition case. It can happen that the second
coordinate don't get bigger but the first one certainly does unless we
multiply by zero or one.

In our race interpretation, the product omega times two corresponds to
a superhero, say Achiles capable of jumps of length omega. Just omega
represent one jump of Achiles, omega times two represents two jumps of
Achiles. Of course that the achiles gets further by the second step.

But what if we summon the turtle against Achiles. Has the turtle a
chance of catching him? Is there an ordinal alpha such that omega
times alpha equals omega? Let's see.

After one step, turtle is at the point one and Achiles is allready at
the point omega. The turtle needs omega more steps to getting to that
point but Achiles is at the point omega times omega by the time, let's
denote it omega squared for short. After next omega steps, the turtle
gets to the point omega times two while achiles gets to the point
omega squared times two. And so on. When the turtle gets to the
the point omega squared while the Achiles is at the point
omega cubed. The achiles is still one round before the turtle. Turtle
at omega cubed, Achiles at omega to the power of four. And so on.

But you know how it goes. There is a supremum of all natural powers of
omega, reasonably enough called omega to the power of omega, and the
turtle catches the achiles at that point. We can understand omega to
the power of omega as the point just after the spiral. Alternatively,
in the opint of view of well ordered sets, omega to the power of omega
is the spiral itself.

We are not going to go into details of ordinal powers, the definition
is more technical and less visual. Just note that it is perfectly fine
to define it by transfinite recursion. The limit step is the
supremum and the successor step is multiplication by omega from the
right. This is important, we allready know, that omega times omega to
the power of omega is still the same, so if we defined it otherwise we
would get stuck at that point. On the other hand, multiplication from
the right guarrantees us to reach higher ordinals.

At the end of the chapter let's compute the size, that is the
cardinality of omega to the power of omega. The size of omega is
aleph 0. The size of omega squared is aleph zero times aleph zero
that is still aleph zero. Analogously, the size of omega cubed is
aleph 0, the size of omega to the power of four is aleph zero and so
on.

Finally, omega to the power of omega is a supremum of countable many
countable ordinals. Supremum is a kind of union, that is merging the
elements, so the size of omega to the power of omega is still
countable, more precisely aleph zero.

Apparently, it is not easy to get an uncountable ordinal number. In
fact, the ordinal power does not help it either. However, we will
explore an uncountable ordinal number in the next chapter. See you
then.
