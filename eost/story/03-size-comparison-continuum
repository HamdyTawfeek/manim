Set size comparison and continuum
=================================

Quote: Some infinities are bigger than other infinities. -- John Green

Outline
=======
* $\P(X) = {}$labeling X by 0,1
* $|\R| = \P(\omega)$?, injections to both sides
* Cantor-Bernstein (graph proof),
* excercise: $\R^2 = \R$
* unanswered questions: Are every two sets comparable? Are reals the least uncountable set?
* Cantor's theorem in general,  $|\P(X)| > |X|$.
* $\P(\P(\P(\omega))) > \P(\P(\omega)) > \P(\omega) > \omega$

In the last video, we have shown several sets of the size aleph 0 --
natural numbers, prime numbers, integers, rational numbers, and
one bigger set, the set of all infinite sequences of zeros and
ones. The current chapter is devoted primarily to this particular bigger
size.
