In the last video, we have shown several sets of the size aleph 0 --
natural numbers, prime numbers, integers, rational numbers, and one
bigger set, the set of all infinite sequences of zeros and ones. The
current chapter is devoted primarily to this particular bigger size.

First of all, an infinite sequence of zeros and ones is in a sense the
same thing as a subset of omega, the set of all natural numbers.
Indeed, we can interpret the sequence as a mask. Zero at a position n
means "don't take the number n", one means "take it". So we can
translate a sequence of zeros and ones, that is a mask, to the set
itself, and vice versa, any set of natural numbers can be encoded into
such a mask by writing ones to the positions of occuring numbers and
zeros to the rest.

More formally, this translation can be considered as a matching
between all sequences of zeros and ones and subsets of omega. So we
actually have proved that the set of all subsets of omega has the same
size as the set of all infinite sequences of zeros and ones. In fact,
this procedural description of matching is quite common in set theory
since is difficult to construct a matching of unimaginably large sets
otherwise.

This operation, taking all subsets of a set is pretty common procedure
in set theory.

. Take a set X, for example the set of numbers 0,1,2, and
. consider all the subsets, that is the empty set, three subsets
. containing just one element, three subsets containing two elements and
. the set itself, and pack it to another set.
. The operation is denoted by a caligraphic P, meaning
. power-set.  Thus, the resulting set is denoted P of X.
. 
. The reason for such a name is inspired by the behavior in finite case.
. We started with a set of size three, and the resulting set have 8
. elements, that is 2 to the power of three. That is not a coincidence,
. we can decide whether to include the number zero, that are two cases,
. whether to include the number one, again two cases, and whether to
. include the number two.  So the total number of subsets is two times two
. times two. It applies in general. If there is a finite set of n
. elements, we can decide for each of them whether to include it, or
. not, and the size of the powerset is then two to the power of n.

In finite case, it is obvious that powerset creates bigger sets, two to
the power of n is much larger than n, right? From the last video we
know that that the power-set overcomes even the countability, the
powerset of omega is larger than omega. Does that hold in general? Is
the power-set of any set larger than the original set?

In fact, the Cantor's diagonal argument was general enough to cover
all possible sets. But let's see it from the power-set perspective to
make it more universal and to see different forms of the same idea.

Take the power-set of a set, say omega, and consider a matching of
natural numbers with members of the power-set, that is subsets of
omega. We want to find a missing subset in that matching.

Some numbers are matched with a set that contains it. For example the
set matched with zero contains zero, ot the set matched with four
contains four.  Other numbers are missing in their corresponding
subset: One is missing in the set matched with one, two is missing in
the set matched with two, and so on.

Now, take the set of all missing elements. This one cannot occur in
the matching. It cannot be matched with any missing number because it
includes it and, on the other hand it cannot be matched with any
included number, because such number would not be included
anymore. And really, this idea is actually the same as saying that the
diagonal is blocking any position of the set but for this argument, we
don't need to be able to draw it.  We divide elements to "included"
and "missing" and take the missing ones.  So power-set is a general
tool for making infinite sets bigger. And it serves for the finite
case as well, so we could say that the Cantor's diagonal argument
provides a proof that two to the power of n is bigger than n. But it
is kinda overkill, don't you think?

Another famous example of an uncountable set is the set of all real
numbers. In the rest of the chapter we will see how the size of all
reals, usually called continuum and denoted by a fraktur c,
and the size of the powerset of omega are connected.

The reason why reals are uncountable is actually simple. If we take a
sequence of zeros and ones encoding a subset of omega, it can be
transformed into a real number by writing zero point before it.  Sure,
we have missed a lot of real numbers, for example minus one, ten, zero
point one. But we have matched an uncountable set P of omega to a part
of real numbers. So reals cannot be countable either.

Does it mean that the size of P of omega is less that the size of reals?
No, until we look over all possible matchings and check whether there
is no matching covering all real numbers. In fact, there is one. All
what we need is to take a real number and encode it into a subset of
omega. There are many ways how to do it, for example the following
one. The decimal representation of a real number can consist of twelve
symbols: ten digits, the decimal point, and the minus sign.  We
enumerate these symbols by numbers from one to twelve. Now, when a
real number comes, we rewrite it using our encoding and then transform
the sequence to a set by succesive summation of elements.

Now, all real numbers are covered by design but some subsets are
missing this time. For example, zero is never in a subset constructed
in this way.  So it seems that reals form a smaller set than P of
omega until we check all possible matchings to check whether they are
not equal. It is tempting to say that there is just one possible
outcome, the sizes of the two sets have to be equal since a set cannot
be smaller and bigger at the same time, right?

But it is just our definition of being bigger or smaller inspired by
the finite comparison. We are not guarranteed that whatever definition
of bigger and smaller sets we make up will work as we expect. We could
see a paradoxical behaviour even with countable sets. So, it is true
that a set cannot be greater and smaller at the same time but it
desires a justification.

:----------------------CantorBernsteinScene------------------------
. There is a green matching which covers all reals but not all subsets of omega.
. And then another red matching covering all subsets of omega
. but not all reals. We would like to somehow
. combine these two matchings so that every real number will be
. connected with just one subset of omega.
. 
. The trouble-makers are primarily such elements that are not covered by
. one of the matching, for example the real number five which is not of
. the form zero point and then some zeros and ones. So we need the other
. matching assigning it the one-element set containing 6. That means
. that we cannot use the appropriate green connection between the
. singleton containing 6 and the real number zero point zero zero zero
. zero zero zero one. So we have to take the green connection from that
. real number again. By this procedure, we take an infinite journey from
. a point not covered by the green matching by the steps which are
. guaranteed to exist. That is red step from reals to subsets and green
. step from subsets to reals. On this path we are forced to use green
. connections.

Similarly, if we start with a point which not covered by the red
matching, we find a path on which we are forced to take the green
connections.

And what about the other points which are not on any of these two
kinds of paths? They can be connected by a red edge and the green
edge at the same time. Or, they can be in a cycle path. Or in an
both-sided infinite path. Nevertheless, such points can be matched by
both colors so it is up to us what color we like more, for example
green.

So the proof goes as follows. Divide the whole picture into three
types of components. One-sided infinite paths starting at the top,
one-sided infinite paths starting at the bottom, and the rest, that is
both-sided sequences and cycles. In the first case take red edges, in
the second take green edges and in the third one take say again green
edges. By merging these components together, we have extracted a
single matching between our two sets which covers both sides.

In general, this is the proof of so called Cantor-Bernstein theorem
which exactly states that a set cannot be smaller than another and
bigger than it at the same time. But can still be some unclear stuff
around the set comparison. Namely we should not be sure yet whether
every two sets are comparable, that is whether we can allways find a
matching of one of them to a part of the other. And another natural
question is to ask whether the cardinal number continuum, which
measures the real line or the power set of omega, is the smallest
uncountable cardinal. The answer to the first question is "Yes" but we
need the set theory built for the proof so you can expect it in the
end of the series.

The second question is tricky, it is called the continuum hypothesis
and it is open, that is no one knows the truth. But in this case, it
is open in another sense than other famous open problems like Riemann
hypothesis, or P-NP problem. Usual open problems are open because
nobody solved them yet. But the continuum hypothesis is proven to be
open forever. However the proof of unsolvability of the continuum
hypothesis is too advanced for this series at all.

In the next chapter, we will look at the idea of constructing a large
set by transfinite recursion. See you then.
