In the last video, we have shown several sets of the size aleph 0 --
natural numbers, prime numbers, integers, rational numbers, and
one bigger set, the set of all infinite sequences of zeros and
ones. The current chapter is devoted primarily to this particular bigger
size.

First of all, an infinite sequence of zeros and ones is in a sense the
same thing as a subset of omega, the set of all natural numbers.
Indeed, we can interpret the sequence as a mask. Zero at a position n
means "don't take the number n", one means "take it". So we can
translate a sequence of zeros and ones, that is a mask, to the set
itself, and vice versa, any set of natural numbers can be encoded into
such a mask by writing ones to the positions of occuring numbers and
zeros to the rest.

More formally, this translation can be considered as a matching between
all sequences of zeros and ones and subsets of omega. So we actually
have proved that the set of all subsets of omega has the same size as
the set of all infinite sequences of zeros and ones. In fact, this
procedural description of matching is quite common in set theory
since is difficult to construct a matching of unimaginably large sets
otherwise.

This operation, taking all subsets of a set is pretty procedure common
in set theory. Take a set X, for example the set of numbers 0,1,2, and
consider all the subsets, that is the empty set, three subsets containing
just one element, three subsets containing two elements and the set
itself. The operation is denoted by a caligraphic P, meaning power-set.
Thus, the resulting set is denoted P of X.

The reason for such a name is inspired by the behavior in finite case.
We started with a set of size three, and the resulting set have 8 elements,
that is 2 to the power of three. That is not a coincidence, we can decide
whether to include the number zero, that are two cases, whether to include
the number one, again two cases, and whether to include the number two.
So the total number of cases is two times two times two. In general, if
there is a finite set of n elements, we can decide for each of them whether
to include it, or not, and the size of the powerset is then two to the
power of n.

In finite case, it is obvious that powerset creates bigger set, two to
the power of n is much larger than n, right? From the last video we know that
that the power-set overcomes even the countability, the powerset of omega is
larger than omega. Does that hold in general? Is the power-set of any set
larger than the original set?

In fact, the Cantor's diagonal argument was general enough to cover all
possible sets. But let's see it from the power-set perspective to make it
more universal and to see different forms of the same idea.

Take the power-set of a set, say omega, and consider a matching of natural
numbers with members of the power-set, that is subsets of omega. We want to
find a missing subset in that matching.

Some numbers are matched with a set that contains it. For example the set
matched with zero contains zero, ot the set matched with four contains four.
Other numbers are missing in their corresponding subset: One is missing
in the set matched with one, two is missing in the set matched with two,
and so on.

Now, take the set of all missing elements. This one cannot occur in the
matching. It cannot be matched with any missing number because it includes
it and, on the other hand it cannot be matched with any included number,
because such number would not be included anymore. And really, this idea
is actually the same as saying that the diagonal is blocking any position
of the set but for this argument, we don't need to be able to draw it.
We divide elements to "included" and "missing" and take the missing ones.
So power-set is a general tool for making infinite sets bigger. And it
serves for the finite case as well, so we could say that the Cantor's
diagonal argument provides a proof that two to the power of n is bigger
than n. But it is kinda overkill, don't you think?

Another famous example of an uncountable set is the set of all real
numbers. In the rest of the chapter we will see how the size of all reals
and the size of the powerset of omega are connected.

The reason why reals are uncountable is actually simple. If we take a
sequence of zeros and ones encoding a subset of omega, it can be
transformed into a real number by writing zero point before it.
Sure, we have missed a lot of real numbers, for example minus one, ten,
zero point one. But we have matched an uncountable set P of omega
to a part of real numbers. So reals cannot be countable either.

Does it mean that the size P of omega is less that the size of reals?
No, until we look over all possible matchings and check whether there
is no matching covering all real numbers. In fact, there is one. All
what we need is to take a real number and encode it into a subset of
omega. There are many ways how to do it, for example the
following one. The decimal representation of a real number can consist
of twelve symbols: ten digits, the decimal point, and the minus sign.
We enumerate these symbols by numbers from one to twelve. Now, when
a real number comes, we rewrite it using our encoding and then
transform the sequence to a set by succesive summation of elements.

Now, all real numbers are covered by design but some subsets are
missing this time. So it seems that reals form a smaller set than
P of omega until we check all possible matchings to check whether
they are not equal.
