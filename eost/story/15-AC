The controversial axiom
=======================

The Axiom of Choice is necessary to select a set from an infinite number of pairs of socks, but not an infinite number of pairs of shoes. --â€‰Bertrand Russell

* The axiom of choice, do not confuse with the axiom of selection
* statement: for any set of non-empty disjoint sets, we can find a set intersecting each of them in exactly one element
  * explanation: we can do infinite number of non-predescribed choices at one time
  * if they are predescribed, axiom of replacement suffices
  * if there is just a finite number of them, we can construct the selection set in a usual way
* ordinary usage: Union of countable sets? Haine's theorem? (just one of them)
* paradoxical usage: Prisoners? Non-measurable set? (just one of them)
* axiom of choice is a forgotten axiom, the opposite to the axiom of regularity
