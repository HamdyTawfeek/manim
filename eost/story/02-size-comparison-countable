:---- Scene1 -----
. Assume that we have some apples and some pears. And we would like to
. figure out what is more. Well, that's an exercise for first year
. pupils of elementary school, we just compute the number of apples,
. then the number of pears and since 5 is more than 4, there are more
. apples than pears.
.
. But let's go before elementary school, imagine that you cannot
. count. How could you determine what is more? There is another option:
. matching pears with apples. We see that when we make such pairs, there
. is one extra apple, so there are more apples than pears. 
.
. And even if we reorder apples or pears and try an absolutely different matching
. the result is still the same. There is one more apple. Isn't that surprising?
.
. Well, it isn't because we can count. We know that 5 apples minus 4
. pears is one extra apple. It is not surprising at all. At least until
. we meet infinity...

:---- Scene2 -----
Let's have an infinite number of apples, each sitting at a natural
number, and an infinite number of pears also each sitting on a natural
number. There is a natural matching between apples and pears, so there
should be the same number of them. But if we use another matching,
connecting the pear at number 0 to the apple at number 1, the pear at
number 1 to the apple at number 2, and so on, there is one extra
apple. So there should be more apples than pears.

And similarly, there can be one extra pear. How to manage it? The
reasonable way how to untangle this is the following definition.
:{"Definition"}
Consider two sets, $A$ and $B$.
:{Boxes around apples and pears}
If there is any matching between $A$ and $B$ such that every element
of $A$ and every element of $B$ is used exactly once, we say that
these two sets have the same size. We write size by absolute value, so
we can write is like that,
:{$|A|=|B|$}
the size of $A$ equals the size of $B$.

If, on the other hand, if there is no way how to match these sets together,
:{Finite number of pears, matching attempts}
and no matter how we try, we can just match the elements of the set
$B$ with a part of the set $A$, we say that the size $A$ is bigger
than $B$.

But this definition leads us to several surprising observations. Take
the set of all natural numbers. And then take just the subset
consisted of all even numbers. Intuitively, the number of even
naturals should be less than the number of all naturals. After all, we
discarded an infinite number of odd naturals something like the half
of all numbers here. But there is a simple correspondence between
natural numbers and even numbers:
:{|natural numbers|=|even natural numbers|}
We can just match every number with its double, zero with zero, one
with two, two with four, three with six and so on. So the number of
all even numbers is the same as the set of all naturals. 

It was not really important to take exactly natural numbers. If we
take squares of integers, we can match zero with zero, one with one,
two with four, and so on. Or if we take just prime numbers, we can
match then zero with two, one with three, two with five, and so on. If
we take any infinite subset of natural numbers, however sparse, the
size will still be the same.

Let's introduce
:{upbrace: finite sizes}
some notation now. Sizes of finite sets are determined by natural
numbers, zero, one, two and so on. In general, sizes are measured by
so called cardinal numbers. Now, we have introduced an infinite
cardinal number,
it is called Aleph 0. The inventor of set theory, George cantor
established aleph, the first letter of Hebrew alphabet for the notation.
Perhaps he considered both latin and greek alphabets too
mainstream...

We already know that Aleph 0 is the least infinite
size because every infinite part of it is still the same size. That's
why there is the zero at the subscript. All
:{downbrace: countable sizes}
these sizes are called countable meaning that natural numbers are
enough for counting its elements even though we may need all natural
numbers. During the rest of this chapter we will mainly investigate
the properties of the size aleph 0 and countability.

We will show the notation on the example with even numbers. We already
know that the set of even numbers can be matched with natural numbers,
that means that the number of even numbers is aleph 0. Similarly, the
set of odd numbers has the size aleph 0. So there are two sets of size
aleph 0 which altogether gives again a set of size aleph 0, the set of
all naturals.

But for size comparison, the particular elements does not really
matter. Just because we know that there are some sets of size aleph 0
which altogether have again the size aleph 0, we can generalize this
fact to whatsoever two sets with size aleph 0. They can be again our
sets of apples and pears. Each of them has the size aleph 0 but
altogether they still have the size aleph 0. So aleph 0 plus aleph 0
is still the same size aleph 0. Alternatively speaking, the union of
two countable sets is still countable. There is a meaningful
example. The number of non-positive integers, zero, minus one, minus
two and so on, is aleph 0. They are just natural numbers reflected by
the point zero. And there are aleph 0 of natural numbers. So the
number of all integers is still Aleph 0.

Q:"Hey, what happened to the merged zero?"
Technically, the size could be less than aleph zero because two zeros
were merged to one
A:"The size is still countable infinite."
but there is just one infinite countable cardinal number, the
Aleph 0. So the size is still the same in our case.

All right, omega can be divided to two sets of the same size, odd
numbers and even numbers. We can go on and partition even numbers to
numbers divisible by four and the others. All these three sets are
infinite countable, thus of size aleph 0, so aleph 0 times three is
still aleph 0. Let's continue and partition numbers divisible by 4 to
those which are divisible by 8 and those which are not. Then partition
the numbers divisible by 8 to those which are divisible by sixteen and
the others. And so on.

We end up with an infinite table of natural numbers. Every number
occurs here exactly once with the exception of missing zero which has
disappered somewhere in infinity. Nevertheless, the size of every row
is aleph 0, there are aleph 0 rows. But all elements altogether are
just natural numbers without zero, that is there are aleph 0 of
them. That shows that aleph 0 times aleph 0 is still aleph zero. More
generaly, the union of countable sets is still countable.

In this case, we can even directly describe the matching. The numbers
in a row with an index r, say 3, is filled by odd multiplies of 8, in
general two to the power of r. That is there is the number 2 to the
power of r times 2 i plus 1 at the position i of the row. So, when
these sets are filled by some other elements, we can just match an
element at the position i of the row r with the natural number given
by our formula. To tune it into perfectness, we tweak the formula
by shifting by one to the left so we cover even the missing zero.

Let's see this in practice. We already know that the size of all
integers is aleph 0. Similarly, the set of all integers divided by two
is of the same size. The same holds for integers divided by three,
integers divided by four and so on.

What if we merge all of these sets? The line becomes pretty
full. There are actually all rational numbers. Every number of a form
an integer divided by a non-zero natural number were in some of our
rows so it is in the resulting set. Therefore, the size of all
rational numbers is aleph 0 as well. And again, technically, some
points got merged but aleph zero is the only countable infinite
cardinal number, so the size cannot be anything else.

Q:"Are all sets countable?"
Considering all this you could be under the impression that actually every set
can be countable.
A:"Of course not."
But in that case, the notion of countability and aleph 0 would be
quite useless, don't you think? In fact, there is a whole variety of
uncountable cardinals and the aleph 0 is just the first of infinite
cardinals, by no means the last one. A famous example of an
uncountable set is the set of all real numbers. While the line seems
to be filled by rational numbers, the vast majority of it is in fact
still missing.

But real numbers are technical a bit so for now let's see another
famous example: The number of all infinite sequences of zeros and ones
is uncountable. Indeed, whenever we make an atempt of matching natural
numbers with such sequences we can find a sequence we have missed by
the following procedure. Look at the digits on the diagonal, that is
the digit at the position zero of the sequence matched with zero, then
the digit at the position one of the sequence matched with number one,
and so on. Finally, we invert the sequence, that is replace the zeros
with ones and vice versa. This sequence cannot be in in our list
because the diagonal is blocking all possible rows. And it is not the
only sequence missing, it would not be problem since aleph 0 plus one
is still aleph zero. But if we add it, we can find another one by the
same procedure. In fact, the vast majority of sequences is missing, an
uncountable cardinal number of them.

The procedure of finding missing sequence is called Cantor's diagonal
argument and in the next chapter we will explore it in more detail and
more generality. You can also expect the explanation of the technical
details of real numbers together with another key set-theoretical tool
making set size comparison cleaner, the Cantor-Bernstein theorem. See
you then.
