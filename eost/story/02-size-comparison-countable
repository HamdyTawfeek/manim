:---- Scene1 -----
. Assume that we have some apples and some pears. And we would like to
. figure out what is more. Well, that's an exercise for first year
. pupils of elementary school, we just compute the number of apples,
. then the number of pears and since 5 is more than 4, there are more
. apples than pears.
.
. But let's go before elementary school, imagine that you cannot
. count. How could you determine what is more? There is another option:
. matching pears with apples. We see that when we make such pairs, there
. is one extra apple, so there are more apples than pears. 
.
. And even if we reorder apples or pears and try an absolutely different matching
. the result is still the same. There is one more apple. Isn't that surprising?
.
. Well, it isn't because we can count. We know that 5 apples minus 4
. pears is one extra apple. It is not surprising at all. At least until
. we meet infinity...

:---- Scene2 -----
Let's have an infinite number of apples, each sitting at a natural
number, and an infinite number of pears also each sitting on a natural
number. There is a natural matching between apples and pears, so there
should be the same number of them. But if we use another matching,
connecting the pear at number 0 to the apple at number 1, the pear at
number 1 to the apple at number 2, and so on, there is one extra
apple. So there should be more apples than pears.

And similarly, there can be one extra pear. How to manage it? The reasonable way how to untangle this is the following definition.
:{"Definition"}
Consider two sets, $A$ and $B$.
:{Boxes around apples and pears}
If there is any matching between $A$ and $B$ such that every element of $A$ and every element of $B$ is used exactly once, we say that these two sets have the same size. We write size by absolute value, so we can write is like that,
:{$|A|=|B|$}
the size of $A$ equals the size of $B$.

If, on the other hand, if there is no way how to match these sets together,
:{Finite number of pears, matching attempts}
and no matter how we try, we can just match the elements of the set $B$ with a part of the set $A$, we say that the size $A$ is bigger than $B$.

But this definition leads us to several surprising observations. Take
the set of all natural numbers. And then take just the subset
consisted of all even numbers. Intuitively, the number of even
naturals should be less than the number of all naturals. After all, we
discarded an infinite number of odd naturals something like the half
of all numbers here. But there is a simple correspondence between
natural numbers and even numbers:
:{|natural numbers|=|even natural numbers|}
We can just match every number with its double, zero with zero, one
with two, two with four, three with six and so on. So the number of
all even numbers is the same as the set of all naturals. 

It was not really important to take exactly natural numbers. If we
take squares of integers, we can match zero with zero, one with one,
two with four, and so on. Or if we take just prime numbers, we can
match then zero with two, one with three, two with five, and so on. If
we take any infinite subset of natural numbers, however sparse, the
size will still be the same.

Let's introduce
:{upbrace: finite sizes}
some notation now. Sizes of finite sets are determined by natural
numbers, zero, one, two and so on. Now we introduce an infinite size,
it is called Aleph 0 (a funny comment about Hebrew alphabet and a
reason of the zero?) and we already know that it is the least infinite
size because every infinite part of it is still the same size. All
:{downbrace: countable sizes}
these sizes are called countable meaning that natural numbers are
enough for counting its elements even though we may need all natural
numbers. During the rest of this chapter we will mainly investigate
the properties of the size aleph 0 and countability.

We will show the notation on the example with even numbers. We already
know that the set of even numbers can be matched with natural numbers,
that means that the number of even numbers is aleph 0. Similarly, the
set of odd numbers has the size aleph 0. So there are two sets of size
aleph 0 which altogether gives again a set of size aleph 0, the set of
all naturals.

But for size comparison, the particular elements does not really
matter. Just because we know that there are some sets of size aleph 0
which altogether have again the size aleph 0, we can generalize this
fact to whatsoever two sets with size aleph 0. They can be again our
sets of apples and pears. Each of them has the size aleph 0 but
altogether they still have the size aleph 0. So aleph 0 plus aleph 0
is still the same size aleph 0. Alternatively speaking, the union of
two countable sets is still countable. There is a meaningful
example. The number of non-positive integers, zero, minus one, minus
two and so on, is aleph 0. They are just natural numbers reflected by
the point zero. And there are aleph 0 of natural numbers.

TODO:
=====
Comment, perhaps with student's question, on what happened to merged
zero: it is still countable and infinite, therefore aleph
0. $\omega\times\omega$, proposal: continue with splitting even
numbers to 2 mod 4 and 0 mod 4, then numbers divisible by 4 by
divisibility by 8 and so on. It is not the well-known mainstream
picture of diagonals but it can be still visualized pretty well and we
get a simple exact formula for the bijection. Meaningful example,
rational numbers. Completing the picture: opposites Infinite and
uncountable. Is there anything uncountable? Statement (perhaps without
proof at this chapter).
