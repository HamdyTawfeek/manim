Combo of the transfinite recursion and the axiom of choice
==========================================================

* Why are every two sets comparable?
* By transfinite recursion, we add edges
  * If we defined it on all ordinals, we get a contradiction with replacement and the class of ordinals being a class
  * Do we really needed working with a class and the axiom of replacement?
    * No, but it is convenient.
    * If we wanted to avoid it, we could use the set of all ordinals embeddable into bijections
* generalization: Zorn's lemma (call it Zorn's lemma or the Principle of maximality?)
  * it is actually similar to previous chapter
  * it is an interface between set theory and the rest of mathematics
* The well ordering principle
  * other reason why every two sets are comparable
